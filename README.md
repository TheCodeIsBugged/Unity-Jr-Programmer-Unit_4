In this Unit, you will program an arcade-style Sumo battle with the objective of knocking increasingly difficult waves of enemies off of a floating island, using power ups to help defeat them. In creating this prototype, you will learn how to implement new gameplay mechanics into your projects, which are new rules or systems that make the game more interesting to play. On one hand, you will learn to program a powerup, which give the player a temporary advantage. On the other hand, you will learn to program increasingly difficult enemy waves, which make survival more challenging for the player. A good balance of powerups and increasing difficulty make for a much more interesting gameplay experience.

Challenge Overview: 
Use the skills you learned in the Sumo Battle prototype in a completely different context: the soccer field. Just like in the prototype, you will control a ball by rotating the camera around it and applying a forward force, but instead of knocking them off the edge, your goal is to knock them into the opposing net while they try to get into your net. Just like in the Sumo Battle, after every round a new wave will spawn with more enemy balls, putting your defense to the test. However, almost nothing in this project is functioning! Itâ€™s your job to get it working correctly.

Challenge Outcome:
1. Enemies move towards your net, but you can hit them to deflect them away
2. Powerups apply a temporary strength boost, then disappear after 5 seconds
3. When there are no more enemy balls, a new wave spawns with 1 more enemy
